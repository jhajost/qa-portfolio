# Lektuarium – QA Case Study Overview

## Product Overview
Lektuarium is a web-based application designed to help users catalogue and manage their personal libraries.
Key features include:
- adding books manually or via barcode scanning (ISBN)
- retrieving book metadata and covers from external sources
- managing reading status and library visibility
- basic social features such as profiles and inviting friends
- setting up multiple libraries and shelves

## My Role
I performed exploratory and functional testing as an external tester, focusing on real user workflows.
Testing was done voluntarily to support product quality and to gain hands-on QA experience on a live system.

## Testing Scope
The testing focused on:
- adding books via barcode scanning
- book metadata accuracy (ISBN, title, cover)
- library management (status, visibility)
- navigation and usability on mobile
- cross-browser behaviour

Performance and security testing were out of scope.

## Test Environments
- Mobile (Android): Chrome, Firefox
- Desktop (Windows 11): Chrome, Firefox

## Testing Approach
My approach was exploratory and risk-focused.
I tested the application using real data (a personal library of 160 books) to identify:
- functional issues
- cross-browser inconsistencies
- state management problems
- integration edge cases with external data sources

Findings were reported to the developer, and several issues were confirmed and fixed.
