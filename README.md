# QA Portfolio

I am an analytical QA Tester with a background in surveillance, gaming operations, 
and beta testing (BlackBerry 10 developer program).

My testing approach is investigative and risk-focused, similar to analysing 
systems for weaknesses and edge cases.

- Test case design
- Bug reporting
